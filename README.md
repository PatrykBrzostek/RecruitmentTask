# Task 2: scraping the “site” command
## Usage instructions
Python 3.8 is required. You can run the script by the command:
```bash
python task_two.py [--keywords-file KEYWORDS_FILE] [--max-number MAX_NUMBER]
```
- KEYWORDS_FILE - text file with keywords, default = keywords.txt
- MAX_NUMBER - Max number of results generated by Google. Default = 10 (first page). Real number of results could be smaller than chosen, because Google treats some blocks (e.g. a images block) like results.

Example:
```bash
python task_two.py
python task_two.py --max-number=50
python task_two.py --keywords-file=your_keywords.txt
```

## Comments
- Keywords in the input file have to be separated by a new line.
- The number of results, which Google shows at the top of the results page is rounded (by Google) if results show on more than one page. The final number is different.
- I am able to find a link pointing to the next page of results, but Google treats every request as a new query. Instead you can use the parameter 'max-number', then Google shows the chosen number of results on the one page.
- The script generates the two output files: output_results.csv and output_number_of_results.csv. If you run the script more than one time, the new output is added to a existing content of files.
- More comments are in the code.

## Ideas on how the software can be improved in the future.
- add parsing more arguments like filenames of output files 
- make a one general class GoogleSearchScraper to scrape Google results and then make another class, which inherits from it and queries google by our query pattern (site:{site_url} {keyword}).
- catch more exceptions and test the script
- validate inputs

## Are there any risks associated with using such a program?
- to be banned by Google

# Task 3: 120 Years of Olympic History data analysis
The code of my script is in the [task_three.ipynb](task_three.ipynb) notebook.
## What countries receive the most medals nowadays? Does it change much across the timespan?
At the last summer Olympic Games (in this dataset) the most medals was won by United States, Germany and Great Britain. At the last winter Olympic Games the top 3 countries was Canada, Russia and United States. Script generates full list of top 3 countries per each games.
## Who wins the most medals? Women or men?
Men have won 28530 medals and women have won 11253, so more medals are won by men.
## What’s the trend for the number of participants?
The number of participants has increasing trend. You can see trend lines per both seasons (summer and winter) below.

## What is the relation between age and medals won?

## Do tall people win more medals?
I assume that the 10% of the tallest peaople are tall. 24.0% of tall participants won medals, when 14.14% of other participants won medals, so tall people win more models. Actually this and the next questions should be analysed with gender separation.

## Which sports are dominated by short people? (You must define "short")
I assume that sport is dominated by short people, when at least 40% of participants are short. At this case I assume that the 25% of the shortest people are short (if percentage is lower than less sports are dominated).
Sports dominated by short people are: Gymnastics, Weightlifting, Diving, Softball, Synchronized Swimming, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Trampolining, Short Track Speed Skating.
## Which families (same surname) win the most medals?
The dataset contains only field name, so it is impossible to detect which parts of name are two-part surname or second name.
